# HS_Deckcode_OCR

**Note:** This project is still very much incomplete. Some code will be awful and some things are outright broken, I plan to address all of that in time

This program uses OCR to read Hearthstone decklists professional players post on Twitter, and transform that data into a deckcode with which the users can import the deck into their own games. This removes the need for the pro players to add the deckcode into their tweets, something that some players won't even bother to do right now.

Current goal is to make the ocr recognition more accurate and the code more resilent to bad readings.
